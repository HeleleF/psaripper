## Custom npm script

`npm start` runs `npm-run-all -p ng:serve electron:main`.

1. `ng:serve` and `electron:main` are running in parallel
2. `ng:serve` builds Angular locally and runs it on localhost. Changing the source will automatically recompile and reload the page.
    - note we dont pass the `-o` flag, since we dont want the browser to open (we access localhost through electron's window)
3. `electron:main` starts nodemon, which in turn runs `electron:serve` everytime the electron entrypoint ( the `main.ts` file) changes
    - note we also use `--watch` to watch for changes to the `src/app/shared` directory, because the files in there are imported in `main.ts`
4. Every `electron:serve` call runs `tsc` to compile the electron entrypoint to javascript and then runs `electron` with it. We pass the `--serve` flag to signal a development build.
    - note the command starts with `wait-on tcp:4200`. This is necessary because we cant show the localhost website if it doesnt exist yet (the `ng:serve` isnt done).

# ELECTRON ENTRY POINT

This is the main entry point for electron.
Meaning, to start it manually, you would call `npx electron mainElectron.js`.

The default way from the template repo was to use the `main.js` file directly.
But since we're using modules here, this fails.

### What to do when electron supports ES modules as entry point?

1. Change field main in `package.json` back to simply `'main.js'`
2. Change scripts in `package.json` to `electron .` instead of `electron ./mainElectron.js` (works since electron looks for `main.js` by default)
3. Remove esm (`npm uninstall esm`)
4. Remove this file

### Why does it fail?

Electron does not support ES modules as the main entry point file.
The issue that tracks this seems to be [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21457).

### The problem is:

1. `main.js` (compiled from `main.ts`) contains the _new_ import statements.
2. Electron fails with `'SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module'`
3. To fix this, one can change `main.js` to `main.mjs` OR adding `type: 'module'` in `package.json`. (Both solutions mark the js file as a ES module).
4. Now electron fails again with: `'Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: Must use import to load ES Module: .\main.js'`
5. As long as electron doesnt change its internal requiring code to use import(), using ES modules will therefore fail.

### Solutions:

-   One could change the typescript target back to `es5`, which converts the import statements, therefore resolving the error. (`main.js` is then not a ES module anymore)

-   Another way is described [here](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21457#issuecomment-703298653)

We create another file (this one) to act as the new entry point. As can be seen below, we have no import statement here, making this a commonjs file.
The esm package (`npm install esm`) loads our ACTUAL entry point logic and exports it again.

This way we can have a fancy ES module as entry point to electron.
